# Winmine-Retro-Game

Game Introduction:

1 The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking or otherwise indicating each square.

2 If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed.

3 The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or mark the square as containing a mine.
